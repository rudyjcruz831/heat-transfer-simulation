type System struct {
	SolarRadiation float64 // The level of solar radiation in the system
	// AmbientTemperature float64 // The ambient temperature in the system
}

// This struct is used to store and manage the solar radiation and ambient
// temperature data within the solar energy system.
// The SolarRadiation field holds the value of solar radiation,
// which indicates the intensity or power of sunlight available
// for energy conversion. The AmbientTemperature field represents
// the surrounding or environmental temperature in the system.
// These values are important for the operation and performance
// of the solar energy system, as they affect the efficiency
// and output of solar panels and other components.
